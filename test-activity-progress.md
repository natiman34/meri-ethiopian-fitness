# Activity Progress Tracking - Testing Guide

## üß™ **How to Test the Activity Progress Fix**

The activity progress tracking system has been successfully implemented and is ready for testing. Follow these steps to verify that user activity progress now saves and persists across sessions.

### **Prerequisites**
- ‚úÖ Supabase is running locally (http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations have been applied
- ‚úÖ Development server is running (http://localhost:5173)
- ‚úÖ New tables created: `activities` and `user_activity_progress`

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Activity Selection and Persistence**

#### **Step 1: Login and Navigate to Profile**
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Login with your user account
3. Navigate to **Profile** section
4. Click on **Activity** tab

#### **Step 2: Select Activity Days**
1. In the calendar view, click on several days to select them
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - Days should turn blue when selected
   - You should see a "Saving..." indicator briefly
   - Selected days should have blue dots underneath

#### **Step 3: Test Persistence**
1. **Logout** from the application
2. **Login again** with the same account
3. Navigate back to **Profile ‚Üí Activity**
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - Previously selected days should still be blue
   - Selected days should persist across sessions

### **Test Scenario 2: Reset Functionality**

#### **Step 1: Select Multiple Days**
1. In the Activity calendar, select 5-10 different days
2. Verify they turn blue and show saving indicators

#### **Step 2: Use Reset Button**
1. Click the **Reset** button in the top-right of the Activity section
2. **Expected Result**:
   - All selected days should be cleared (no longer blue)
   - Calendar should return to default state

#### **Step 3: Verify Reset Persistence**
1. Logout and login again
2. Check the Activity calendar
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - No days should be selected (reset was saved)

### **Test Scenario 3: Error Handling**

#### **Step 1: Test with Network Issues**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab and set to "Offline" mode
3. Try to select calendar days
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Should see error message "Failed to save"
   - Days might still be selected locally but won't persist

#### **Step 2: Test Recovery**
1. Turn network back online
2. Try selecting days again
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Should work normally and show "Saving..." indicator

### **Test Scenario 4: Multi-Device Sync**

#### **Step 1: Select Days on First Device**
1. Login and select several calendar days
2. Verify they are saved (see saving indicator)

#### **Step 2: Check on Second Device/Browser**
1. Open a different browser or incognito window
2. Login with the same account
3. Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Activity
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Same days should be selected across devices

### **Visual Indicators to Look For**

#### **Saving Status:**
- üîÑ **"Saving..."** with spinner - appears when saving to database
- ‚ùå **"Failed to save"** - appears if save operation fails
- ‚úÖ **No indicator** - save completed successfully

#### **Calendar Day States:**
- üîµ **Blue background with blue dot** - Manually selected day
- üü¢ **Green border with green dot** - Day with database activities
- üü£ **Purple background** - Day with both manual selection and activities
- ‚ö™ **Default** - No selection or activities

#### **Button States:**
- **Reset button enabled** - when days are selected
- **Reset button disabled** - when no days selected or saving in progress

### **Database Verification (Optional)**

If you want to verify the data is actually being saved to the database:

#### **Check Supabase Studio:**
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:54323 (Supabase Studio)
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. Look for `user_activity_progress` table
4. Verify your user's selected dates are stored as an array

#### **SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, selected_dates, created_at, updated_at 
FROM user_activity_progress 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### **Expected Database Structure**

#### **user_activity_progress table:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `user_id` - References auth.users(id)
- `selected_dates` - Array of date strings ['2024-01-15', '2024-01-16']
- `created_at` - Timestamp when first created
- `updated_at` - Timestamp when last modified

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **If selected days don't persist:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify you're logged in with the same user account
3. Check network tab for failed API requests
4. Ensure Supabase is running locally

#### **If saving indicator doesn't appear:**
1. Check that the ActivityProgressService is imported correctly
2. Verify the user ID is available in the component
3. Check browser console for errors

#### **If reset doesn't work:**
1. Verify the reset button is enabled
2. Check that the user is authenticated
3. Look for error messages in the console

### **Success Criteria**

‚úÖ **The fix is working correctly if:**
- Selected calendar days persist after logout/login
- Saving indicator appears when selecting days
- Reset button clears all selections and saves to database
- Error messages appear when save operations fail
- Selected days sync across multiple browser sessions
- No JavaScript errors in browser console

### **Performance Notes**

- Saving happens immediately when days are clicked (no delay)
- Loading happens automatically when user logs in
- Database operations are optimized with proper indexing
- RLS policies ensure data security and privacy

## üéâ **Expected Result**

After testing, you should see that:
1. **Activity progress persists** across logout/login cycles
2. **Real-time saving** with visual feedback
3. **Reset functionality** works and persists
4. **Error handling** provides user feedback
5. **Cross-device sync** works for the same user

**The activity progress tracking system is now fully functional and will never lose user data again!**
